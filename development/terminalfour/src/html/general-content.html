                    <p class="postblock">Commemorating the 1916 Rising presents many opportunities to reflect on its many international dimensions. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Charlie Flanagan T.D., commented: <em>“Ireland in 1916 was, as it is now, a global island, a nation that both reflected and was engaged in the bigger international issues of the day. This is why I asked Ireland’s network of embassies and consulates to plan events which will engage our diaspora and friends abroad, as well as to present the Ireland of today to the world. And our diaspora and friends of Ireland around the world have already set to work with gusto.”</em></p>
                    <p>The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. will host a three-week festival of Irish arts and culture</p>

                    <li>From March to July 2016, the Irish Embassy in <strong>Buenos Aires</strong> will hold schools’ essay and art competitions, which will encourage participants to reflect on themes that include the Easter Rising and Irish-Argentine relations.
